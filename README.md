# Traffic-Assignment
Traffic-Assignment is a repository for static traffic assignment python code. Currently, the program can solve the static traffic assignment problem using user equilibrium (UE) and stochastic user equilibrium (SUE) for the city network. The solution can be achieved both using MSA and Frank-Wolfe algorithm.



#How to Run


Use "testing" or "ta" to run traffic assignment
